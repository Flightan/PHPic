Design:
	Add a new visual for 'protected' and 'private'
	Add a shadow above of the footer when a user scrolls

Conception:
	Refactor the code to allow an easy change to the daemon
	Rewrite the daemon with python --maybe
	Create a config file (possibly an install script)
	Stop using fixed height and width on resize to not mess up photos not 2:3
	Add a "Download the original" link
	Write a form to change from public to protected and private
