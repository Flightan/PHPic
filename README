PHPic is designed as an easy way to share your pictures on your server. Simply clone this repository, set-up your VHOST and run the Daemon script to create an elegant album sharing solution.


Setting Up Your VHOST
=====================

The following is a sample VHOST you might want to consider for your project.

<VirtualHost *:80>
   DocumentRoot "/path/to/phpic/public"
   ServerName phpic.local

   # This should be omitted in the production environment
   SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development
    
   <Directory "/path/to/phpic/public">
       Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride All
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
   </Directory>
    
</VirtualHost>


Setting Up Permissions and Crons
================================
In order to set correct permissions to folders and to add the daemon to cron just execute "script.sh" once.
sudo ./launch.sh


Album scope
===========
Each album can be public, protected or private. In order to change the scope, you just have to modify the xml file.
For example : 
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<collection>
  <album title="winter_013" scope="public"/>
  <album title="spring_013" scope="private">
	<user name="florian"/>
	<user name="camille"/>
  </album>
  <album title="summer_013" scope="protected"/>
</collection>
